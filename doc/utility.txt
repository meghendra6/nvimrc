NERDTREE
Key 't'(cursor at the nerdtree navigation bar) makes new tab in the top

EMMET
emmet_expandabbr_key
  - is working on n,i mode
  - the key binding '<C-y>,' I interpreted as 'a rest' before completion

Yank & Clipboard
  - To copy into clipboard, I use <C-c>, <C-x>, <C-v>
  - To yank, just y. I commented 'unnamedplus' to seperate purpose.

VIM jsdoc
  - I force to insert input prompt when :JsDoc
    I think it is faster & explicit way.
    But if want to create empty format, press ESC or ENTER continuosly.

Tagbar
  - I Transferred the default jsctags from Esctags & nested
    checking configuration for the reason of the speed issue
